#### Abstract
Multi-sensor IoT devices can be used to monitor different environmental phenomena. Often deployed over large areas, these devices depend on batteries and renewable energy sources for power. We develop efficient energy management solutions to maximize device lifetime while ensuring appropriate and sufficient data is captured to be processed by the IoT application. We leverage cooperative sensing with multiple sensors working together to further increase energy efficiency and minimize temporal overlap. We adapt the device load to available renewable energy using Model Predictive Control (MPC) to optimize sensing tasks and develop and evaluate a low-complexity approximation to MPC suitable for execution on IoT devices. Our Predictive EneRgy Management for IoT (PERMIT) is implemented on a prototype lightweight solar-powered IoT device using a Raspberry Pi and multiple sensors, developed along with HP Labs. We then develop cooperative sensing by using a distributed “Block scheduler” scheduler to manage sensing across multiple IoT devices that minimizes temporal sensing overlap across neighboring IoT devices.

This is joint work with Elizabeth Liri, Koushik Kar, Puneet Sharma and Geoff Lyon.

#### Abstract
The Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) has advanced rapidly, transforming the perception in how data can be stored and processed in order to get the benefits from the collected data in particular industry applications, i.e., preventive maintenance, device production, planning in manufacturing, etc. The Internet of Things Stack has evolved to integrate advanced data management capabilities to cope with the emergent needs in industrial markets, i.e., privacy and security concerns, large amounts of data processing, federated access to information, etc. In this talk, the full IoT Stack will be reviewed, and the data continuum will be explained, starting at the edge of the technology and understanding the IoT data life cycle, from data collection to data marketplaces. The management of the “universally”
connected devices used to be a priority in the Internet of Things. Still, today, this has been “level up” towards managing not only the devices but also the data that the loT platforms and the end-user applications those devices are able to support. The Internet of Things Stack was defined including device management techniques (i.e., autonomic, self- management); that have been developed over the run of these years. Management paradigms are emerging, and is clear that the loT developments have triggered the evolution in different directions, from looking to more powerful devices that process large amounts of data at the Edge to a larger development in the number of interoperable loT platforms where the development of architectures in the cloud and cross-domain applications can use the data seamlessly offering new end-user applications. Therefore, this multidirectional evolution has resulted in the creation of several parallel loT ecosystems, some of them open but the majority proprietary ecosystems. Finally, we will also address the challenges and proposed solutions for the interoperability of these parallel loT ecosystems, the current standard propositions, and the management techniques for the delivery of data services over those loT platforms.

#### Abstract

In this presentation, we examine the current applications of wireless Operational Technology (OT) networks and explore the potential of both 5G and a sneak peek into 6G as wireless communication technologies ready to meet the demanding communication needs of Industry 5.0 applications. We showcase the capabilities of a 5G campus network deployed within indoor factory floor scenarios, leveraging the latest advancements from the commercially available 3GPP release-16.
 By conducting an extensive measurement campaign, we acquire detailed insights into various aspects including coverage maps, reference signal power, channel quality indicators, and throughput. Moreover, we analyze end-to-end delay measurements across different channel conditions, considering 5G quality of service priorities and varying traffic loads. This comprehensive analysis aids in shaping a potential trajectory for the digitalization of industries, ushering in a realm of cyber-physical continuity that necessitates precise communication to enable seamless end-to-end services.
 Drawing from the insights of the EU project DETERMINISTIC6G, we tackle this challenge through a novel architecture that integrates Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) and Deterministic Networking (DetNet). This architecture also incorporates data-driven network performance awareness and the concept of digital twins to enable determinism and enhance safety within 6G networks. In conclusion, we offer a glimpse into the future by exploring the integration of environmental awareness into communication links. This integration holds the promise of advancing the deterministic and reliable behavior of wireless communication within controlled environments.

#### Abstract
“Properly connecting processing nodes with sensors and optimization on physical or wireless layers are two of the goals that Industrial IoT (IIoT) experts are trying to meet, along with high-speed data transmission and scalability for different topologies and needs. But how can we program IIoT devices to achieve low transmission latency while ensuring network operations align with the required traffic load and user intents?
In this talk, we will explore how ML methods can be used in conjunction with data-plane programming languages to efficiently profile network loads while using intents to help administrators and programmers customize their networks according to their needs.”
